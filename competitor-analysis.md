## Keyword Ranking Analysis

### "Carpenter Bath" - Who Appears on Page 1
Based on search results, the following appear prominently:
1. **Elite Carpentry & Construction** (elitebath.co.uk) - appears to rank well
2. **KO Carpentry & Joinery** (ko-carpentry.com) - appears in results
3. **Mark Baker** (Carpenters Central listing)
4. Directory sites (Rated People, Carpenters Central, etc.)
5. **Artisan Carpentry** and **SSC Carpentry Bath** also appear in broader searches
6. **J Thomas Carpentry** (bath-carpenter.co.uk) - strong domain but doesn't always appear top

### "Fitted Wardrobes Bath" - Who Appears on Page 1
1. **Bespoke Walk In Wardrobes** (bespokewalkinwardrobes.co.uk) - niche national site
2. **Bath Bespoke** (bathbespoke.co.uk) - has a dedicated fitted wardrobes page
3. **Valentino Kitchens** (valentinokitchens.com)
4. **Bath Bespoke Joinery Company** (bathbespokejoineryco.co.uk) - separate company
5. **Kingston Cabinetry** (kingstoncabinetry.co.uk)
- **Note:** None of the smaller carpenters rank for this term - dominated by specialists and Bath Bespoke

### "Media Wall Bath" - Who Appears on Page 1
1. **media-walls.co.uk** (national niche site)
2. **mediawallbuilders.co.uk** (national niche site)
3. **media-wall-installers.co.uk** (national niche site)

## Key Findings & Opportunities for CN Carpentry

### 1. The Competition is Weak (Except Bath Bespoke)
- 5 out of 8 competitors have basic/dated single-page or minimal websites
- Only Bath Bespoke has a genuinely strong online presence
- Matt Thomas has the best SEO structure but is based in Weston-super-Mare, not Bath

### 2. Nobody Has Individual Area/Location Pages
- **ZERO competitors** have individual pages for locations like "carpenter in Corsham", "carpenter in Bradford-on-Avon", "joiner in Keynsham" etc.
- This is a **huge SEO opportunity** for CN Carpentry to dominate local searches

### 3. Almost Nobody Has a Blog
- Only Bath Bespoke has a real blog (30+ posts)
- Matt Thomas has 1 blog post
- Everyone else: nothing
- A blog targeting long-tail keywords ("how much does a fitted wardrobe cost in Bath", "best wood for sash windows", etc.) would be a massive differentiator

### 4. Media Wall is Wide Open
- No local carpenters rank for "media wall Bath"
- Only national niche sites appear
- A dedicated service page for media walls could capture this traffic easily

### 5. Google Reviews are Underutilized
- Most competitors have few or no visible Google reviews
- Actively collecting Google reviews would provide a strong competitive advantage in local pack rankings

### 6. Individual Service Pages are Rare
- Only Bath Bespoke and Matt Thomas have proper individual service pages
- Most competitors list everything on one page
- Creating dedicated pages for each service (fitted wardrobes, media walls, kitchens, staircases, etc.) with unique content is a big opportunity

### 7. FAQs are Rare
- Only Matt Thomas and Boatswain have FAQ content
- FAQ schema markup can win featured snippets and "People Also Ask" boxes

### 8. Structured Data is Largely Absent
- Most competitor sites don't appear to use schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, Review)
- Implementing proper structured data would give CN Carpentry an advantage in rich search results

## Recommended Strategy for CN Carpentry

### Must-Haves (Immediate)
1. **Professional website** with modern design (at minimum matching Boatswain's quality)

6. **Portfolio/gallery** with before/after photos and case studies
7. **Testimonials page** with embedded Google reviews
8. **FAQ page** with FAQ schema markup
9. **LocalBusiness structured data** on every page

### Should-Haves (Within 3 months)

2. **Dedicated media wall page** - capture this uncontested keyword
3. **Social media profiles** (Instagram for visual portfolio, Facebook for local presence)
4. **Schema markup** for all services, reviews, and FAQs

### Nice-to-Haves (6+ months)
